Censored Data

Type II censored data: It occurs when a life test is
terminated exactly when a pre-specified number of failures have occurred. The remaining units have not yet failed. If n units were on test, and the pre-specified number of failures is r (where r is less than or equal to n), then the test ends at t r = the time of the r-th failure. 

For instance, this sample was censored after 7 failures and the remaining units were 3.

The times to failure were:
```{r}
n <- 10
bulbs <- c(125,189,210,356,468,550,610)
r <- length(bulbs)
```

Estimate the parameter:
$$\theta = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^r t_{(i)} + (n-r)t_{(r)}}{r}$$

```{r}
theta <- (sum(bulbs) + (n-r)*max(bulbs))/(r)
```
