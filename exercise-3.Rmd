Keating (2002) studied the annual numbers of females with cubsof-the-year
in the Yellowstone grizzly bear population, from 1986 to
2001. Shown in the next Table is the number of unique females with
cubs-of-the-year that were seen exactly j times during the year 1998.

```{r}

#Sights of unique females with cubs-of-the-year (1998).
sights <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
nbears <- c(11,13,5,1,1,0,2)

nbears[1]^2/(2*nbears[2])
```

This is a multiple capture-recapture problem where the main objective is to know the total number of females.
